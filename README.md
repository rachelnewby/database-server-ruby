# Database server tech test in Ruby

## The Problem 
Write a program that runs a server that is accessible on http://localhost:4000/. When your server receives a request on http://localhost:4000/set?somekey=somevalue it should store the passed key and value in memory. When it receives a request on http://localhost:4000/get?key=somekey it should return the value stored at somekey. Store the data in memory, not in a database, but bear in mind that you will later need to add a database to this code.

## The Solution
